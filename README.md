# McCulloch & Pitts Single Layer Perceptron Model

In 1943, -first ancestor of machine learning algorithms-, 'Perceptron' was created. This single layer perceptron is not learning (because; weights are not updating for every epoch, according to the loss function) but this model was the first baby steps of the machine learning algorithms for modern era.
